Tech: MERN, Prisma client, oAuth0, JWT, Leaflet, Framer Motion, Mantine UI, Cloudinary.

 ◦ Developed this Real-Estate CRUD app. Its a Full-stack app comprising whole MERN stack, Prisma client for performing
 Type-safe operations on database, Framer motion for few animations, Leaflet for integrated map and location pointer.
 Used oAuth0 for user authentication and JWT (Json Web Tokens) for database security. Used Cloudinary for cloud
 media storage services.
 
 ◦ Auser can use our app to look for properties which are put on sale by other users. User can authenticate itself on our
 app and can Like/Unlike and can add any property of their choice to Favourites.
 
 ◦ This also has Geography filter search functionality to search properties based on their geographical locations. I have also
 integrated Maps and location pointer for precise property location on maps.
 
 ◦ Since it is a CRUD app, users can also publish their properties for sale. Add photos, location, description, facilities and
 property published. When the sale is completed, users can also delete their publishings.
